Hello everyone, I’m Koorapetse Lesotlho. I’m thrilled to be here today to share my journey as a DevOps Engineer and Machine Learning & AI specialist. My path has taken me from the vibrant classrooms of Botho University, where I now lecture, to the innovative corridors of Orange Botswana, and even into the world of freelancing as a machine learning engineer. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Network Security from Botho University, where I developed a fascination for the intersection of technology and security. I then pursued a Master’s of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong University, diving deep into the realms of computer vision and data science. What drives me is the power of technology to transform lives and industries. I believe we stand at the precipice of an era where AI and machine learning can solve some of our most pressing challenges. My mission is to inspire the next generation of innovators to harness these tools responsibly and creatively. Today, I invite you to explore with me the incredible possibilities that lie ahead in the world of technology. Together, we can shape a future where our innovations serve humanity and drive positive change.
